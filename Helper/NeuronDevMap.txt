# Mapping neuron IDs to specific devices.
# Start by simple format:
# [Pre neuron ID, Post neuron ID, target w, target b]
# -Later upgrade so that if Neuron ID field is omitted, neurons are dynamically mapped in order of priority and the mapping logged.
# -Remember to introduce condition that lines starting with '#' are comments.
# -The accepted delimited is the ',' character.
# -Blank lines should be ignored automatically by code.
